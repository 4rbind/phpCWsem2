<h1>About Us</h1>
<p>
Trader Joe’s is a national chain of neighborhood grocery stores. We are committed to providing our customers outstanding value in the form of the best quality products at the best everyday prices. Through our rewarding products and knowledgeable, friendly Crew Members, we have been transforming grocery shopping into a welcoming journey full of discovery and fun since 1967.
</p>
<p>
At Trader Joe's, you won’t find a lot of branded items. Instead, you’ll discover a store full of unique and interesting products, along with everyday basics, in the Trader Joe's label.
</p>
<p>
Our buyers travel the world searching for products we think are exceptional and will find a following among our customers. To earn a spot on our shelves, each product is submitted to a rigorous tasting panel process, in which every aspect of quality is investigated in context of the price we can offer. If a product is assessed as an outstanding value, it becomes an essential part of the Trader Joe's shopping adventure.

We buy in volume and contract early to get the best prices.
</p>
<p>
If an item doesn’t pull its weight in our stores, it goes away, making room for another innovative new product.
</p>
<p>
Most grocers charge their suppliers fees for putting an item on the shelf. This results in higher prices... so we don’t do it.
</p>
<p>
We keep our costs low because every penny we save is a penny you save.
We want our customers’ experience while shopping in our stores to be rewarding, eventful and fun. Our helpful, friendly Crew Members take care in maintaining safe and inviting neighborhood stores; in crafting creative, informative signage to support our customers’ understanding of our products; and in creating a store environment that imparts adventure, humor and a warm sense of community.
</p>
<p>
Simply put, every time a customer shops with us, we want them to be able to say, “Wow! That was enjoyable, and I got a great deal. I look forward to coming back!”
